# 🌸 Iris Flower Species Classification using SVC

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a **machine learning classification model** to predict the species of Iris flowers using **sepal and petal measurements**.  
The model is trained using the **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** algorithm and is supported by **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for better data understanding.

The classifier predicts the following species:
- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the **Iris Flower Dataset**, a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning classification problems.

### Features
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

### Target
- Species

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following visualizations are included:
- **Pairplot** – Feature relationships and class separation  
- **Correlation Heatmap** – Correlation between numerical features  
- **KDE Joint Plot** – Density distribution of petal features  

These plots help in understanding the data before model training.
