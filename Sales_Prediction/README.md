# Sales Prediction using Python 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts product **sales** based on advertising expenditure using **Machine Learning (Regression)**.  
It helps understand how TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisements affect sales.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses the **Advertising dataset**, which contains the following columns:

- TV – Advertising spend on TV  
- Radio – Advertising spend on Radio  
- Newspaper – Advertising spend on Newspaper  
- Sales – Product sales (Target Variable)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Dataset loaded and explored (EDA)
- Checked for missing values
- Analyzed correlation between features and sales
- Split data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- **Linear Regression** model was used to predict sales.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Since this is a **regression problem**, accuracy is not used.  
The model is evaluated using:
- **R² Score**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**

The model achieved a **good R² score**, indicating strong prediction performance.

---

## 🔮 Prediction Example
The trained model can predict sales for new advertising values, such as:
- TV = 200
- Radio = 50
- Newspaper = 30
