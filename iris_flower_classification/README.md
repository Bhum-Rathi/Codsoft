# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the species of an Iris flower
based on its sepal and petal measurements.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify Iris flowers into different species using
machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers.
Each sample has four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target variable is the species of the flower:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
